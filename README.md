# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Multiple Linear Regression with __scikit-learn__.

In this project, I will build and evaluate multiple linear regression models using Python. I will use __scikit-learn__ to calculate the regression, while using __pandas__ for data management and __seaborn__ for plotting. The data for this project consists of the very popular __Advertising dataset__ to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through media such as TV, radio, and newspaper.

### The key objective of this project is to learn the following skills:
1. Build univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn
3. Evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE
4. Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Importing Libraries
- __Task 2:__ Load the Data
- __Task 3:__ Relationship between Features and Response
- __Task 4:__ Multiple Linear Regression - Estimating Coefficients
- __Task 5:__ Feature Selection
- __Task 6:__ Model Evaluation Using Train/Test Split and Metrics
- __Task 7:__ Interaction Effect (Synergy)
